# Themes from Mid-Term Survey

## What are folks unsure about?

* Geographic coordinate systems and map projections.
* Spatial overlay/analysis methods

## Not remembering tools, nervous about exam, unsure about the project, etc..

* GIS is **not** about memorization, it is about problem solving, critical thinking and reflection.  You'll almost always have access to the internet when doing GIS, if you don't know something, look it up!

* The exam will be open book.  You'll be able to complete it anytime during a 3-day window (April 19th - 21st).  You will have 6 hours to complete it.  The exam is **not** intended to take you six hours, I just don't want you to feel rushed/overwhelmed.
  * More details will be given next week.
  * I will the last lecture review for the exam on April 7th.


* I've given an extensive list of possible [project ideas](https://june-skeeter.github.io/FinalProjects_GEOS270/docs/Ideas.html).
  * You can also chat with your TA in lab to think through ideas and get some tips.


* If need some help flushing the idea out and determining a workflow, or you are unclear on any material, please don't hesitate to drop by my office hours! (In person or on Zoom)
  * I'm happy to schedule zoom meetings at other hours *with advanced notice*

## Miscellaneous

* Navigating github & Downloadable lectures

<!-- # Flowcharts

The flowchart is an important requirement for you final project and there will be a flowchart question on the final exam.

* Flowcharts are a useful tool for quickly summarizing your workflow.  It is important to be able to share what you've done and explain methods so people can trust your results.
* They can also be useful for planning a workflow.  You can draw out possible options, think through scenarios, and maybe catch logical flaws **before** you start doing an analysis.

There are a number of ways to create flowcharts.  You can draw them by hand, an ArcGIS Pro model can serve as an (ugly) flowchart, you can use power point, or you can try [Diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/).  This site allows you to make aesthetically pleasing flowcharts quickly and easily, the video bellow gives you a quick overview of how to use the too.
