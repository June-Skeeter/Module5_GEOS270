# Project Proposal

Your task for lab this week is to find a group and come up with your [project proposal](https://june-skeeter.github.io/FinalProjects_GEOS270/docs/Proposal.html).  There is a group signup page on canvas.  Once you have a group, **make sure** all your members join on canvas.  Those who fail to join their group, won't get grades for the proposal submission.
