# Redoing the Risk Assessment

Your task for this module is to re-do some aspects of the Port Alberni Tsunami Risk Assessment using the weighted overlay tool.  Specifically, we want to create a more accurate inundation zone that will allow for a more nuanced look at which areas might flood in the event of a Tsunami.

# Learning Outcomes

* Gain Experience with Raster Overlay Methods
* Apply a Multi-Ring Buffers
* More Practice with Model Builder

# Workflow

**1**{: .label .label-red } Use the Euclidean Distance tool to approximate distance from the waterbodies layer

**2**{: .label .label-red } Reclassify the distance and elevation rasters so they are binned in discrete intervals

**3**{: .label .label-red } Use the Weighted Overlay tool to create a more accurate Inundation Zone

**4**{: .label .label-red } Map areas in Port Alberni that could flood in the event of a Tsunami
