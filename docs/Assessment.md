<!-- 23 -->

### QC3 

Burnaby's population is closest to that of ________ but because they have different ______ , they have very different population densities.


### QC4

Vancouver's area is closest to that of ________ but because they have different ______ , they have very different poulation densities.

### QC5

### QC9

### QC10

It is important to ensure our data is in an appropriate map projection.  If you reproject a layer once, it generally won't cause you issues.
