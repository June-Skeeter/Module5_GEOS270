# Assessment

You can use the submit your answers to the Assessment via the Module 3 Quiz on Canvas.  Questions are listed here with hyperlinks to the relevant section of the module if you need help finding answers.


## Written Answers & File Uploads

Written answers should be brief but they should adequately answer the question.  Bullet point format is sufficient unless otherwise specified.  All written answers & charts will be evaluated following this general rubrics below.

* Scores & categories are general guides, you TA may assign scores between these levels
* Your TA will provide brief comments where applicable, if you need more feedback you can follow up with your TA.
